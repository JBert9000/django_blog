* This is my first time taking a look at the Django framework. I am following the tutorial from Corey Schafer - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p

I followed his tutorial on how to build a Flask blog while adding my own elements in. That repo and page can be seen here:

  - Repo: https://github.com/JBert9000/flask_portfolio

  - Heroku Site: http://janbertlik.herokuapp.com/

* I wanted to learn more about Django, and figured the best way to start is to build an application that I have already done, but in a different framework.
